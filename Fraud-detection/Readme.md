During my recent deep learning project, I was tasked with addressing a critical business problem: detecting fraudulent transactions in a large dataset. The primary goal was to achieve high sensitivity, ensuring that as many fraudulent transactions as possible were correctly identified.

One of the main challenges I faced was the severely unbalanced nature of the data. The vast majority of transactions were non-fraudulent, with only a tiny fraction being fraudulent. This imbalance made it difficult for traditional machine learning algorithms to perform well, as they often struggled to identify the minority class (fraudulent transactions).

To overcome this challenge, I employed a variety of techniques, such as resampling the dataset, using different evaluation metrics like sensitivity, and experimenting with multiple algorithms to find the best fit for the problem.

Initially, I tried classic classification methods like Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM). However, the results were not ideal, the sensitivity was barely over 50%. I then shifted my focus to deep learning techniques and used powerful packages like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras to build a more robust model.

The process I followed started with preprocessing the data, followed by splitting it into training and testing sets. I experimented with different deep learning architectures, adding more layers, using dropout for regularization, and fine-tuning hyperparameters. The focus was on improving the model's sensitivity, as it was crucial for detecting fraudulent transactions.

The result was a significant improvement in both overall accuracy and sensitivity compared to the initial methods. The deep learning models, both the original and the improved versions, outperformed the SVM and logestic models in these metrics. The Improved Deep Learning Model provided the highest overall accuracy and sensitivity of over 97%.

From this project, I learned the importance of trying various techniques and adapting them to the problem at hand. Deep learning proved to be a powerful approach to handling imbalanced data and achieving high sensitivity in fraud detection. I also gained valuable experience in using popular tools like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras, which allowed me to create more sophisticated models and achieve better results. Overall, this project was a great opportunity to apply my knowledge and skills to solve a real-world business problem effectively.
